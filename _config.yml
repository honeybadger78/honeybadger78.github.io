            I may not have been the most studious or naturally gifted student,
            but my dedication to pursuing my passions was unwavering.
            My academic journey led me to major in Industrial Engineering and minor in Big Data Software,
            areas where my true interests and hard work converged to forge a unique and robust skill set.

            I focus on developing 6D pose estimation for various objects,
            complemented by my expertise in instance segmentation and object detection.
            I also calibrated the robot and camera, and finally derived the coordinates of the objects from the robot.

          - Description: The system obtains RGB and point cloud data from a reference camera,
           and only RGB from a target camera. Based on these inputs, it performs image matching.
           The system utilizes 2D image matching keypoints and the reference point cloud to estimate the degree of movement and rotation of the target RGB relative to the reference RGB image.
